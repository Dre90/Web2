PROGRAMMING FOR WEB II
LAB 4 / TASK 3

Create an array that includes months and number of days in each month and write two functions.

The first function, printMonths, should take months array as input and print it.

The second function, modifyMonths, should take months array as input and modify its elements.

If a month has 31 days the last character of the month should be upper case and the rest should be lower case.

Months having less than 31 days should stay untouched.

The second function should modify the original array without returning it.

Call the first function.
Call the second function.
Call the first function again.

The output should be:

    I am the first function â€” printing months array!

    'January'=>31 days,
    'February'=> 28 days,
    'March'=>31 days,
    'April'=>30 days,
    'May'=>31 days,
    'June'=>30 days,
    'July'=>31 days,
    'August'=>31 days,
    'September'=>30 days,
    'October'=>31 days,
    'November'=>30 days,
    'December'=>31 days.


    I am the second function â€” just modifying months array!
    I am the first function â€” printing months array!

    'januarY'=>31 days,
    'February'=> 28 days,
    'marcH'=>31 days,
    'April'=>30 days,
    â€˜maY'=>31 days,
    'June'=>30 days,
    'julY'=>31 days,
    'augusT'=>31 days,
    'September'=>30 days,
    'octobeR'=>31 days,
    'November'=>30 days,
    'decembeR'=>31 days.


Hint: You can pass values to functions by reference.
Hint: Recall string functions strrev (reverse a string), ucfirst (capitalise first character of a string) and strtolower (lowercase all the characters of a string).
