PROGRAMMING FOR WEB II
LAB 4 / TASK 5

In one file, create a Shape class and two subclasses, namely Rectangle and Circle.

Shape class should have an area property, area calculation function, and setter and getter methods for area property.

The area calculation method of Shape class should always set area to 0.

Area property of Shape should be accessible only to the objectâ€™s methods itself and not to the those of subclasses.

Methods of Shape class should be accessible only to objectâ€™s methods itself and those of subclasses.

Rectangle and Circle classes should override the area function accordingly and have necessary properties.

Rectangle and Circle classes should have constructors (no parameters), which should call the Shape classâ€™s area calculation method.

Properties of Rectangle and Circle classes should not be accessible to outside, but should be modifiable with a public interface.

Shape class should be able to keep track of the number of objects created for each subclass.

Create an Rectangle object, set its properties and calculate its area.
Create a Circle object, set its properties and calculate its area.
Create a Circle object, set its properties and calculate its area.
Print objects and their areas.
Print the number of rectangle and circle objects.

Destroy one of the Circle objects.
Print the number of rectangle and circle objects.

The output should be like:

	This object is a Rectangle and has an area of 20
	This object is a Circle and has an area of 6.28
	This object is a Circle and has an area of 9.42
	We now have 1 rectangles and 2 circles!
	We now have 1 rectangles and 1 circles!

Hint: You can use built-in get_class method to check the type of an object.
