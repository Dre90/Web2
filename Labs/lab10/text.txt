PROGRAMMING FOR WEB II
LAB 10 / TASK 1

Write a PHP program to add and display people into/from a database.

You should have one php file, which first displays all the people on your database (names and surnames), then provides a basic form to add new people.

You should use JQuery ajax methods and JSON to get and send data to your backend code.
