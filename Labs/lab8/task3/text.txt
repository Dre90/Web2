PROGRAMMING FOR WEB II
LAB 8 / TASK 3

Now create two php files.

The first php file, named list_users.php, should list all the usernames.

Each username should have link assigned over it or a text next to it (e.g., "Show profile").

The links should point to another php page, named show_profile.php.

You should send the username as a part of the URL like the following:

<a href="show_profile.php?user=admin">See Profile</a>
<a href="show_profile.php?user=arild">See Profile</a>
etc.

The show_profile.php file should get the user name from the URL and display all the user data, and if an invalid username is provided should state that the username is invalid.
