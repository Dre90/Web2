PROGRAMMING FOR WEB II
LAB 4 / TASK 4

Create two classes, namely Person and Car, in two different PHP files.

Person class should have name, and owned_car attributes, which should be referenced only by the methods of the current object.

Car class should have plate_number and owner attributes, which should referenced only by the methods of the current object.

For each class define a public interface to set and get attributes of the current object.

For each class also define a construct method.

The construct method of Person class should only accept the name property.

The construct method of Car class should accept both plate_number and owner properties.

Create another PHP file, which first requires all the class files.

Create a person object with a name.

Create a car object with a plate number and the person object (as owner), which you just created.

Set owned_car property of your person object to the car object, which you just created.

Print all the objects with print_r command.

Then print the following text:

	Mike has a car with plate number 1234
	The car with plate number 1234 belongs to Mike

To print first line, you should ONLY and ONLY use the person object to access required data!

To print second line, you should ONLY and ONLY use the car object to access required data!
