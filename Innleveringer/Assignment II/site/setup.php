The eight-month-old farm animal lives with Tilly the British bulldog, Alfie the Boston terrier and Lola the French bulldog in the semi-rural suburb of Glenorie in Sydney, Australia. Her parents, Alissa and Nick Childs, have collected the group of misfits and showered them with love, parties and dress-up costumes.

Olive, who joined the clan in October 2015, spends most of her days either grazing on the lawns or sleeping on the couch with the dogs. She also goes on bush walks with the family.

Their adorable lives are being documented on Alissa's Instagram account, Abby Love Photography. From the blooming friendship of Olive and Lola, the outrageous outfits and their cheeky run-ins with the goats and chickens, there is not a moment of boredom.";

But is Tesla ready for the mass-market long-range EV?

Sure, Tesla showed us a car. It's designed and debuted at least part of it, though the interior is still to come.

For traditional automakers, at this point, they'd be effectively close to the finish line. The research and design (R&D) is the hard part. Sending the final design into production is the easier part (I am speaking very broadly, of course).

Tesla has the unenviable task of scaling up from a small carmaker into a major one.
That's because carmakers like Toyota, for example, have been building cars for almost 80 years, and they have the production process honed to a fine art.

Tesla, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer. In fact, it's produced around 200,000 cars since the company began making cars in 2008. Heck, it's only produced around 80,000 Model S cars.

Now, however, Tesla has the unenviable task of scaling up from a small carmaker into a major one in two years time â€” and not just in terms of production.

In many ways, the upstart automaker operates like a tech company, rather than a traditional car company. This fact is best evidenced in its company-owned stores and Apple-like repair policies.";
